## Buildings
Buildings are essential for resource production, unit training, and research. Each building can be upgraded to increase efficiency.

### Starting Buildings
Each player starts with a village that contains the following buildings:
- **Town Hall**
- **Storage**
- **Farm**
- **Clay Pit**
- **Lumberjack**
- **Quarry**

### Constructible Buildings
Players can construct additional buildings to expand their village:
- **Wall**
- **Hideout**
- **Sawmill**
- **Brickmaker**
- **Stonecutter**
- **Smithy**
- **University**
- **Barracks**
- **Archery Range**
- **Stable**
- **Cannon Foundry**

### Building Progression
- Each building starts at **level 1** and can be upgraded up to **level 50**.
- Upgrading buildings costs **resources** but provides **benefits** such as increased production efficiency or stronger defenses.
- **Resource buildings** generate more resources as their level increases.
- **Unit buildings** allow the creation of military units after being added to the **construction queue**.
- All buildings function **only within their respective village**. Resources and units are **not globally shared**.

---

## World Map & Expansion
- The village exists on a **map** with multiple villages that can be **attacked and conquered**.
- Players can switch between owned villages and upgrade their buildings separately.
- This allows players to expand their **kingdom** and control multiple settlements.
- Trade routes can be established between villages to **automatically send resources**.

### Walls & Defense
- Players can construct and upgrade **walls** on the map to defend villages.
- Each **wall belongs to a village** and is built using that villageâ€™s resources.
- Walls provide increasing defense against enemy attacks as they are upgraded.

### Map Structure
The world map is based on a **coordinate system**, where each tile can be:
- A **village**
- A **wall**
- A **grassland**
- A **forest**

Villages are distributed across the coordinate system and function **independently**.

### Barbarian Villages
- Over time, **stronger barbarian villages** will appear on the map.
- These villages belong to an **AI-controlled kingdom** and become progressively more difficult to defeat.
